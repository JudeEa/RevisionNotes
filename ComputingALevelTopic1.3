## Search Engine Indexing.

The internet was founded in 1969 as a collection of 4 US defense computers called ARPANET. Search engines are tools created to make finding information on the web easier. Submitting a search via a search engine uses an Index. Indexing is the process of a search engine collecting, sorting and storing the data inside its index. When your search results appear it is the search engine index that priovded it.

Searching the index is very fast however it needs to be maintained and updated to ensure things such as new pages arte added and things such as old pages are removed aswell as general upkeep such as removing broken links. Search engines use Spiders. Spiders index any pages, content and metadata they find whilst also mapping links between pages by following every internal and external link. This being done continuosly maintains and updates the index.

## PageRank Algorithm.

The PageRank algorithm is a trademarked algorithm created by one of Google's founders Larry Page. It is used to compile websites and rank them beifre listing the results returned by a search engine. It is the most famous algorithm used to rank search results. It works by checking the number of links to a page in turn creating a sort of abitrary "importance" rank which helps decide which searches are to be returned and in which order. It works on the assumption that a website will be more important the more often it is linked to from other sites. It uses a dampning factor whch stops the alogorithm from having too much or effectively infinite "importance" because of the way that the aglorithm works. 

A webpage's page rank is determined in part by the actual rank of the pages that recomend it. This stops low quality sites from being created to artificially boost another low quality site stopping the system from being easily abused. The algorithm works without needing to know the Pagerank of any back linked pages. 

## Server and Client side processing.

When using the internet the majority of our interactions involve two types of connected entities, the client and the server that holds the web page or resource. Interactions lead to decisions being made aroun whether actions occur client side or server side. These decisions are based on performance, security and usability. Client side processes would be stuff such as, initial data validation, manipulating the user interface elements, applying website styles. Items being completed client side reduces server load and webtraffic. Server side processing is often more detailed and further than clientside processes and couldn'tÂ be completed on the client side. Things completed on the server side could be providing further validation, queries and updates to the server database. Encoding data into readable HTml, keeping organisation data secure and complex heavy calculations.

# Networks

## Network Characteristics and Protocols

A single computer that is not conencted to anything is knows as a standalone machine. Once you connect one computing device to another, either via cable or wirless you ahve a network. Networks have no limit on sizes they can be as small as two devices and theoretically infinite. Users can share files, peripherals and operate around a central server whilst using what seems to be a standalone device. Networks do however present some disadvantages such as security issues.

For things to work effciently we need standards. Protocols are a system used to ensure that standards between technology are kept the same. 

| Acronym | Full Name                           | Purpose                    |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| TCP     | Transmission control protocol       | Communication over LAN/WAN |
| IP      | Internet protocol                   | Communication over LAN/WAN |
| UDP     | User datagram protocol              | Communication over LAN/WAN |
| HTTP    | Hyper text transfer protocol        | Web page requests          |
| HTTPS   | Hyper text transfer protocol secure | Web page requests          |
| FTP     | File transfer protocol              | File Transfer              |
| POP     | Post office protocol                | Email                      |
| IMAP    | Internet message access protocol    | Email                      |
| SMTP    | Simple mail transfer protocol       | Email                      |

TCP provides error free transmission between two routers. The internet Protocol routes packets across a WAN. Together they make the TCP/IP protocol stack, the foundation fo communication over the internet. UDP uses a simple connectionless transmission model. It doesn't have error checking unlike TCP and is used to send short messages using datagrams where speed is more important than accuracy. It maintains an open, two-way connection ideal for online gaming. It is largelty obselte as it is significantly less reliable than TCP.

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is a way for a client and a server to send and recieve requests and deliver HTML web pages. The fundamental protocol of the World wide web. HTTPS is the same but adds encryption and authentication, this should be used whenever a site uses sensitive data such as passwords.

FTP is a protocol used to send files between computers, usually on a WAN. FTP clients are usually used which is specially designed software that sits on top of the FTP. The program allows for full use of the FTP via a customised user interface making file transferring easy and accessible.

POP/IMAP/SMTP Mail servers can be thought of as a virtual online post office. All three of these protocols are used in conjunction with mail servers. SMTP transfrs outgoing emails between servers and from email clients to servers. POP recieves emails from a mail server and transfers them to your device beofre removing them from the server. IMAP keeps emails on the mail server maintaining synchronised results between device

## Internet Structure

Internet is the most well known WAN. Internet != WWW. Home network contains router connected to an ISP, the ISP is connected to a Domain Name server which makes up the backbone of the internet. Protocols are broken up intto layers. Layers divide complex tasks into smaller simpler tasks. Harsdware and software on a certain layer has a defined responsibility. Each one provides a service to the layer above it. Layerind advantages are things such as. Reducing a complex problem into smallter sun-programs which are easier to be solved. Devices can be created with the intention of specifically working at a certain layer. Because products are designed to fit the purpose of a certain layer which is "standardised" products from different vendors can work together.

TCP/IP is one of the most important protocol stacks used today. The stacks refers to a set of network protocols consisting of four layers. All incoming/ outgoing data packets pass up and down the layers. The four layers are as follows.

##### Application Layer

Network applications like web browsers or email programs operate at this layer, protocols such as FTP, HTTPS, SMTP, IMAP, POP.

##### Transport Layer

Sets up communcation between two hosts and agrees on settings like language and packet size. Protocols such as TCP and UDP are used at this layer.

##### Internet Layer

Addressing and packaging data for transmission. Routes packets across the network. IP is used at this layer.

##### Link Layer

Network hardware and connection port standards live here. Operating system device drivers sit here. Facilitates the transmission of binary via any media. Copper twister pair, fibre and Wi-Fi.
